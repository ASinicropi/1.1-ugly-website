<p>A rave is an electronic music dance party that lasts all night.
<br>It can feature performances from DJs or live music performers.</br></p>

<p>One of the most beloved traditions of PLUR is kandi trading.
<br>For those who are new to the scene, kandi is the plastic jewelry (made from pony beads)</br>
 you see people wearing at rave. It is generally made in bracelet, cuff, or necklace form.</p>
